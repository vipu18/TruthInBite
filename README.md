cd TruthInBite
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Get Google AI Studio API Key**

- Get your Google AI Studio API key by visiting [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
- Sign in with your Google account.
- Click"Get API key in Google AI Studio"
- Creating or selecting a Google Cloud project.
- Clicking "Create API key" to generate your free Gemini API key.

4. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key_here"
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

6. **Access the app**
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Interactive web interface)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (OCR and health analysis)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL) for image handling
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for structured data analysis
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv for configuration

## üìä How It Works

### 1. **Image Upload & Processing**
```python
# Upload food label image (JPG, PNG, WebP)
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a food label image...")
image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
```

### 2. **AI-Powered Data Extraction**
```python
# Extract structured data using Gemini AI
product_list = get_structured_data_from_gemini(image)
```

### 3. **Ingredient-Based Health Scoring**
- **High Scores (80-100)**: Natural, whole ingredients with minimal processing
- **Medium Scores (50-79)**: Some processed but recognizable ingredients
- **Low Scores (0-49)**: Highly processed with artificial additives

### 4. **Personalized Health Analysis**
```python
# Analyze based on user's health conditions
warnings = run_health_analysis(product, health_profile)
```
